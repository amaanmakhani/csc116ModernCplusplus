* Week 1

These problems are very simple, but require you learn to do
input and output of strings and numbers. 

| Simple                                                                    | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello][Hello World]]        |

* Week 2

| Use a for loop. make sure your counter variable is local to the loop       | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/timeloop][Stuck In A Time Loop]] |
| Use a function that takes the number of lines to read                      | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/speedlimit][Speed Limit]]          |
| Be careful when convertin floating point numbers to ints                   | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/faktor][Faktor]]               |
| After you solve it, see if you can do it WITHOUT an if statement. See below | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/spavanac][Spavanac]]             |
| Trigonometry. See below                                                    | [[https://open.kattis.com/problems/ladder][Ladder]]               |

1. spavanac

The % operation can be very useful to deal with values that "rotate around a certain limit" operation.

((a +b) % b ) will always return a positive number. For example, (-1 + 24) % 24 => 23

This means you can solve this problem WITHOUT an if statement. The hint is to convert the time to minutes, and then use
the % operator to deal with "invalid" times. Then convert back the minutes to hours when you output.

2. Ladder

Remember to convert degrees to radians. All trig. functions in C++ (and in C) require angles to be in radians.
See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/

Use #include <cmath>
